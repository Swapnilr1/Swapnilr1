<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->

Hi, I am a Masters student in Computer Science at UC San Diego, graduating in December 2023 and currently looking for full time positions starting January 2024. I am very interested in both Software Systems and Programming Languages - so I ideally want to work on any of: distributed systems design and implementation, compilers and programming language runtimes, low-level systems programming. I am proficient in C, and basics of C++. Currently learning Go and Rust.

I have some experience with Java compilers and runtimes: I worked on some modifications to Eclipse OpenJ9 Java VM (an alternative to OpenJDK with its HotSpot VM) and so have a decent idea of JIT compilers, code generation for x86_64, how garbage collectors work etc.
